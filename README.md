## Name
Day Planner

## Description
The day planner is set up in hour chunks from 9am to 5pm.  In each hour, you can enter any appointments or notes and then click on the lock button to save it.  It will persist on the page when the page reloads.  If the current time puts any of the time slots in the past, the background for that time will be gray.  It will be red if it is the current hour and green if in the future.

## Installation
Visit corybenton.github.io/dayplanner to use.

## Usage
Put in any appointments you have during the day and hit the lock button to save.  The color will change on the hour slot as those things pass.  The appointment will persist so is good for daily appointments.  To delete an appointment then delete the text and hit the lock button again to save.
